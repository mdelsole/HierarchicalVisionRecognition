# HierarchicalVisionRecognition
A vision recognition system based on the hierarchical structure of the brain

This system is quite complicated, but in short it is a heavily modified version of the system described in George Dileep's paper, "A generative vision model that trains with high data efficiency and breaks text-based CAPTCHAs".
